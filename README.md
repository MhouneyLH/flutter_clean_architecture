## 📑 About the project

An example Flutter app to show the meaning of a number using clean domain-driven design and TDD. The app is based on this [tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB6lc7nQ1n4iYGE_khpXRdJkJEp9WOech). I updated the code to null safety so that it can be used as a reference for future projects.
